# DevcampDemo
I am working through a pre-work course on devcamp. I'll be making the sample site provided by following along with each lesson.
If you'd like to see all of the site files in one consolidated place, simply open the html.css folder.

Skills used in this site include:
-Parallax scrolling
-grid squares
-skewed nav bar
-media queries for mobile browsers
-contact form
-drop shadows

The folder, "CF project", is the final project for the devCamp Foundation course. It is a clone of an instance of the CodePen homepage.
